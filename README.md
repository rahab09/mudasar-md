### Professional Summary

Problem Solver by Nature | Full Stack Developer by Practice | Tech Collaborator by Choice

Over the past year, I have worked closely with designers, developers, and AI experts to turn many ideas into real products ‚Äî whether that meant building modern Web3 dashboards, mobile-first platforms, or integrating OpenAI into smart business tools.

My primary stack revolves around React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I have been learning blockchain technologies in depth, such as Solidity, Web3.js, and NFT smart contracts. When needed, I also integrate AI tools (Python, OpenAI APIs) to make apps smarter and better.
